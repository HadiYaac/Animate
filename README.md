# Animate

This repository contains a reference implementation from my two-part blog post *["Building a declarative animation framework in Swift"](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/posts/building-a-declarative-animation-framework-in-swift-part-1)*. Note that it's not intended to be used as-is. Instead, it's an example that you can easily build your own animation frameworks on top of.

For questions, comments or feedback, feel free to contact me [on Twitter @johnsundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell).

Happy animating! ðŸš€
